# Fraud-Detection-using-Quantum-Machine-Learning
This repo presents a quantum-inspired fraud detection approach using Qiskit's QuantumCircuit for feature encoding and a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) for classification. It achieves high precision and recall on real-world data, addressing class imbalance and optimized.
